#Things to Note about R 
#It's case sensitive X!=x
#It's object oriented, you'll create variables or objects, change and manipulate them

#Ask True or False questions

#setting a variable "<-" variable <- value assigned
# '=' also works to assign a value
# '<-' was originally the only way to assign a value, distinguishes from '=' or '==' for equal

# T and F are shorthand for TRUE FALSE
# Although I've had some issues where R wanted it written out. I haven't figured out what causes that.

# put a questionmark in front of something for help, as well as the format
# put double question mark ?? in front to make it not case sensitive and explore other libraries
